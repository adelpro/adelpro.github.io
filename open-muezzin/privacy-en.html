  <h1>Open Muezzin Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> November 9, 2025</p>

  <h2>Your Privacy Matters</h2>
  <p>At Open Muezzin, we take your privacy seriously. This policy explains how your data is handled when using our browser extension.</p>

  <h2>What Information Do We Collect?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Geolocation:</strong> Used only to calculate accurate prayer times based on your current position. Your coordinates are processed locally and never sent to external servers.</li>
    <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Used to save your preferences, such as calculation method, location, and notification settings. All data remains on your device.</li>
    <li><strong>Alarms:</strong> Used to schedule prayer time reminders and Athan notifications even when the browser is closed.</li>
    <li><strong>Host Permission:</strong> <code>https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/*</code> is used to convert your coordinates into a readable location (city, country) through the OpenStreetMap Nominatim API. No personal data is transmitted or stored.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
  <p>All permissions are strictly used for prayer time calculations and notification functionality. No data is tracked, profiled, or monetized.</p>

  <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <p>All saved data (preferences and cached coordinates) are stored securely within your browser using Chrome or Firefox storage APIs. Open Muezzin does not use remote databases or third-party analytics.</p>

  <h2>We Don't Share Your Data</h2>
  <p>Since Open Muezzin stores all information locally, no data is shared with any third party. We have no access to your information.</p>

  <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>Open Muezzin is suitable for users of all ages. No personal data or identifiable information is collected from anyone, including children.</p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The only external service accessed is the OpenStreetMap Nominatim API, used solely for converting coordinates to readable locations. No personal data or identifiers are included in these requests.</p>

  <h2>Updates to this Policy</h2>
  <p>This policy may be updated periodically. Any major changes will be reflected here with a new effective date. Continued use of the extension signifies acceptance of any updates.</p>
