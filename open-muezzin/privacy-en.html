  <h1>Open Muezzin Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> November 9, 2025</p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>Open Muezzin is an open-source browser extension that provides accurate, location-based prayer times and optional Athan notifications. Your privacy and security are fundamental to our mission. This document explains what data we process, why, and how it is protected.</p>

  <h2>Information We Collect and Use</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Geolocation:</strong> Used solely to determine precise prayer times based on your position. Coordinates are processed locally in your browser and never transmitted or stored externally.</li>
    <li><strong>Preferences:</strong> Your selected settings (calculation method, location, theme, language, etc.) are saved locally using browser storage APIs (Chrome, Firefox). These remain accessible only on your device.</li>
    <li><strong>Alarms & Notifications:</strong> Utilized to deliver prayer reminders and Athan alerts, even if your browser is not actively open. No data is sent externally during this process.</li>
    <li><strong>Location Conversion:</strong> The OpenStreetMap Nominatim API (<code>https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/</code>) is used strictly to translate coordinates into readable locations (e.g., city, country). Requests contain only latitude and longitude — no identifiers, tokens, or personal data.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Security</h2>
  <p>All information is stored locally and managed through secure browser APIs. Open Muezzin has no external databases, no telemetry, and no analytics scripts. The extension does not connect to or transmit data to any remote server controlled by us or third parties.</p>

  <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not share, sell, or transfer your data. All operations (including location handling and notifications) occur entirely on your device. Open Muezzin has no mechanism to access or retrieve your personal information.</p>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>Open Muezzin is safe for all age groups. It does not collect, store, or process any personal data, including from minors.</p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The only third-party interaction occurs with OpenStreetMap Nominatim for coordinate conversion. Open Muezzin does not use analytics, cookies, or any marketing-related APIs.</p>

  <h2>Open Source Transparency</h2>
  <p>Open Muezzin is fully open source. You can review, audit, and contribute to the project via the public repository on GitHub:</p>
  <p><strong>Source Code:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/adelpro/open-muezzin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/adelpro/open-muezzin</a></p>
  <p>Our open-source approach ensures that users and developers can verify that no tracking, profiling, or hidden data collection exists.</p>

  <h2>Policy Updates</h2>
  <p>This policy may be updated to reflect improvements or changes in browser API behavior. Updates will appear here with a revised effective date. By continuing to use the extension, you acknowledge and accept the most recent version of this policy.</p>
