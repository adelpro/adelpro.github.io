    <h2>What Information Do We Collect?</h2>
    <p>Open Mushaf <strong>does not collect any personal information</strong> or any other data from users. The app runs completely offline, and no data is transmitted from your device.</p>

    <h3>Why Do We Not Collect Data?</h3>
    <p>Our primary goal is to provide a seamless, offline experience for users. Since the app functions offline, there is no need to collect any data for analytics, performance monitoring, or any other purpose.</p>

    <h2>We Respect Your Child's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Open Mushaf is designed for children aged 6 and above who can read Arabic. We are committed to protecting children's privacy. Since our app does not collect any data, children's information is completely safe.</p>

    <h2>Keeping Your Data Secure</h2>
    <p>Since we do not collect any data, there is no personal information to protect. However, we still prioritize app security to ensure a safe user experience by regularly monitoring the app for potential vulnerabilities.</p>

    <h2>We Don't Share Your Data</h2>
    <p>As Open Mushaf collects no data, there is nothing to share with third parties. Your privacy is fully protected.</p>

    <h2>Your Privacy Rights</h2>
    <p>Since no personal data is collected, there is no need for data deletion requests or management of personal information within the app.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Open Mushaf does not use any third-party services for analytics, tracking, or data collection. The app runs entirely on your device without sending any information externally.</p>

    <h2>Updates to this Policy</h2>
